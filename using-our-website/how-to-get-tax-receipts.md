# How to get Tax Receipts

Since Charity Soul is a registered 501c3, we can provide donation reciepts on request. Currently, you are able to request a donation reciept for a timeframe. In order to do this, you can visit the profile page ( https://charitysoul.io/profile ) and click the "Download Tax Reciept" button.&#x20;

In order to download donation reciepts, we are required to collect personal identifying information. It is not possible to claim tax deductions anonymously.

When you download your donation receipt, your instant donations as well as monthly yield distributions will be showcased on the receipt in USD value. Below is an example donation receipt
