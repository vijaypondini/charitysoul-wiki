# Points System

#### **What are points?**

Our points system is a way of quantifying your yield in a non-USD format. This is done to encourage gamification of making donations and generating yield via the LST.

***

#### **How do I earn points?**

Points are earned automatically at the end of every epoch based on your holdings of charitySOL. The yield generated by the LST is swapped into USDC and automatically sent to our multisigs.&#x20;

***

#### **How much are points worth?**

1,000 points = $1.00

***

#### **Where do my points go?**

At the end of every month, we clear out the points balances of users so we can make our donations to the charities we work with. Your points are distributed based on your donation preferences

***

#### **What can I do with my points?**

You can choose to hold points as they accumulate monthly. You can also use your points to specifically "give points" to charities, i.e., direct a portion of your LST yield to a charity of your choice. This donation will be processed along with the monthly donations.

#### **Will the points convert to an airdrop?**

No, we do not plan on having an airdrop. Please do not trust any links, misinformation, or people who state there will be an airdrop, and always verify all sources of truth!
