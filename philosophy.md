# Philosophy

CharitySoul has a philosophy of **having real impact on the world**.

When we normally donate money to a charity, the money is often thrown into darkness, with no real explanation of how funds are being used, and what impact your donation is actually making. While there are websites that help you quantify how much impact your donation can make, it's hard to see these at a macro level scale. Charity soul will change that

Since we deal in volumes of donations, our donation effect has a lot more impact than normal. As a result, we should be able to see significant changes in lives that we want to help improve upon. When we make the donations, we will do our best to request for some type of confirmation about what our money is doing for the people. This can involve showing pictures, videos, or receipts that tell us our donation actually went a long way.&#x20;

We also want charity soul to be a charity aggregator rather than a charity itself. While we are registered as a charitable organization, we believe ( for now ) undertaking charitable acts requires a lot more manpower, planning, financial investment and time commitment to execute. We thought about ways to help communities all around the world and not just focus on one place, and we came to the conclusion that donating to charities already existing in that area would be an ideal solution. It's very hard to maintain operations _globally_, but donating to charities that maintain their operations _locally_, we can create real impact all around the globe.

Finally, why did we even think of doing this in the first place? It's because the solana ecosystem is often ridiculed as the casino, the place where degenerates go to lose all their money or win big. But real impact and real change starts here. We must value add something significant to the world with cryptocurrency, and this can be one of many ways to start that. We hope to show that the solana community has this power of making massive change around the world, with your participation.

Your impact in this whole organization helps a tremendous amount of people around the world. We thank you for your contributions.
